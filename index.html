            The insightful and forward-thinking great personality، the Aga Khan had a vision that was conceived several decades ago. Today, the radiance of his wisdom is spread around the globe, where downtrodden strata of society grappling with challenging circumstances are benefiting from his enlightened programs. The Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) was founded in 1967, which flourished into a tall and shady tree.
            ollowing the triumphs of the esteemed Aga Khan Foundation, the Aga Khan continued to raise additional institutions bringing them under the widely recognized Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN). This network has cast a far-reaching influence, with ten institutions established under its umbrella, whose examples are given amongst the nations of the world. Among these institutions, the Aga Khan University has been a leading force in spreading knowledge and enlightenment for many years.

            The Aga Khan University and Hospital is a prestigious and renowned institution in Pakistan that has provided education to numerous students, enabling them to become competent doctors motivated with a sense of patriotism and dedication to people at large. Patients from remote regions of the country seek solace and medical attention from this esteemed hospital when they have lost all hope elsewhere, the institution welcomes them with open arms, providing them with quality care and support. </p>
